### Introduction

This report was created to document a senior-level control systems engineering semester project. This project involves designing a control system for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. A VTOL-class aircraft that can hover mid-air as well as take-off and land vertically. A control system is required to successfully operate an aircraft with VTOL capabilities due to the unusual designs of most rendering it unable to be flown manually. The VTOL aircraft control system involves the control and positioning of a shaft mounted to support in a way that allows for rotation in the plane normal to the support and coincident with the shaft. A propeller is mounted to one end of the shaft and the other end is fixed to the support. The support is placed normal to the surface of the earth so it is parallel with the gravity vector. A counterweight could potentially be added to the other end of the shaft to improve the stability of the system due to the inertial effects of the mass and the less force required by the motor. The control of the propeller thrust is the main method for orienting the aircraft body in the case of this model. The idea of VTOL aircraft has been around since the early 1900s but the first good examples were not created until after World War II. The most common type of VTOL aircraft is the helicopter which is used both in military and civilian applications. There are a handful of jets that are capable of VTOL operation such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the different variants of the Harrier jet.

A few different papers were referenced online to complete this project because we had to figure out how to derive the transfer function for the system, then interface MATLAB with V-REP to demonstrate the functionality of the system. A list of the specific papers can be found in the references section of this paper. Some of the models used in V-REP were made using SolidWorks and then adapted to be compatible with V-REP.
